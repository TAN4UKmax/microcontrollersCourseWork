# microcontrollersCourseWork
 My coursework on microcontrollers course at Belgorod State Technological University.

 These programs allow to use Delta VFD-B to control asynchronous motor with complicated time-frequency diagrams support. Motor can be controled
either from computer with command line program or from ISPDAS I-7188E uPAC. VFDMotorControlWindows.exe runs from windows command line. VFD_MC.EXE can be loaded and run on I-7188 controller. You can find the description how these programs work in coursework report file (./CW_report/CW_report1.docx).
